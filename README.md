# codebase-reader
hackathon project to interrogate codebases
Built for a 2 day internal ai hackathon with the topic 'developer productivity'. 

The idea of the project is to provide a chatbot that understands the structure of the project and can explain how things work, answer questions about the project as a whole (what languages/frameworks/etc.), help devs locate code, or even suggest changes.
